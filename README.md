# ImportJSON

Import JSON from any URL directly into your Google Sheets. `ImportJSON.gs` adds an `=ImportJSON()` function to your spreadsheet, allowing quick and easy JSON importing. To use go to `Tools` > `Script Editor` and add the `ImportJSON.gs` file. Now in your spreadsheet you can access the `ImportJSON()` function. Use it like this:

    =ImportJSON("https://mysafeinfo.com/api/data?list=bestnovels&format=json&rows=20&alias=cnt=count,avg=average_rank,tt=title,au=author,yr=year", "/title")

Here are all the functions available:

| Function                |  Description                                                                      |

## Website archive
This code base used to be hosted at http://blog.fastfedora.com/projects/import-json and contained a lot of useful information. It has been archived at https://rawgit.com/bradjasper/ImportJSON/master/archive/blog.fastfedora.com/projects/import-json.html

## Alternatives
Some of this if possible internally with Google App Scripts External APIs, like UrlFetch: https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/external

These require a Google account and an explicit permission, but in some cases may be a good fit.
